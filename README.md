Problem statement:-

To solve some simple but general asked questions by the followers of the page.

Introduction:-

Chatbot is basically a software that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. They are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition.
The process of building, testing and deploying chatbots can be done on cloud based chatbot development platforms. These cloud platforms provide NLP, AI, and mobile backend as a service for chatbot development.

Purpose of the Project:-

To create a central hub and platform for followers of the GDG siliguri community page in order to solve their simple but generally asked queries so they may resolve their doubts in a much easier manner.

Working Principle:-

Dialogflow (previously known as API.AI) works on the natural language processing and backed by machine learning. At Dialogflow the whole conversation take place, is backed by Google and runs on Google infrastructure. The process of Dialogflow agent follows from invocation to fulfilment is similar to someone answering a question, with some liberaries taken of course.
Agents are best described as NLU modules. It is basically the name of our app we are creating. Whenever the user asks a question, it will try to match in corresponding intent. The Dialogflow agent needs to know what information is useful for answering the users request.
Dialogflow backed by Google hence it works on cloud functions. Context plays vital role in the success of assistant.

Limitations:-

As the database, used for output generation is fixed and limited, chatbots can fail while dealing with an unsaved query.
It is unable to deal with multiple questions at the same time and so conversation oppurtunities are limited.
