Problem statement:
To solve some simple but general asked questions by the followers of the page.

Introduction:
Chatbot is basically a software that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. They are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition.
The process of building, testing and deploying chatbots can be done on cloud based chatbot development platforms. These cloud platforms provide NLP, AI, and mobile backend as a service for chatbot development.

Purpose of the Project:
To create a central hub and platform for followers of the GDG siliguri community page in order to solve their simple but generally asked queries so they may resolve their doubts in a much easier manner.

Working Principle:



Limitations 
As the database, used for output generation is fixed and limited, chatbots can fail while dealing with an unsaved query.
It is unable to deal with multiple questions at the same time and so conversation oppurtunities are limited.
